## Data Science Consulting

This was a consulting project creating during Fall 2014 using sales, demo, and social media data for a real business. The data is randomized and brand and product names are masked. The Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram data were fetched via APIs. 

I coded all of the d3, node+express, and html/css. I also prepped/loaded the mysql data and prepped the linux server. Other contributors were Priya Venkat, Preteek Goel, and Divyansh Argawal.

Technologies used were:
* AWS EC2 (redhat)
* mySQL
* node.js + express.js
* d3.js
* python
