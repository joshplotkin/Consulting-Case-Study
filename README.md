# Data-Science-Consulting

This project was a consulting job using sales, demo, and social media data for a real brand. The data is randomized and brand and product names are masked. The Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram data was fetched via APIs. Other contributors were Priya Venkat, Preteek Goel, and Divyansh Argawal.

Technologies used were AWS (EC2 for server, RDS for MySQL database hosting), javascript (node.js for back end server, D3.js and DC.js for data visualization), python (many scripts to prepare the data and automatically insert into database, plus Alchemy for social media trend analysis).
